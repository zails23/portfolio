      <h2>My Work</h2>
      <p class="intro-text">People hire me so their experiences and the words in them make sense. <br><br>In my ideal gig, I’m with you from the time you’re figuring out where to start until we’re tweaking language after we launch. But I’m happy to meet you where you are too.</p>


      <h3>Favorite Projects</h3>
      <section class="row">
        <div class="col-3-3-3">
          <h4>"Meat Pies! Get Your Meat Pies!"</h4>
          <p>I went back to live in Sydney after studying abroad and pitched The Washington Post to run an article about Australian meat pies, and they accepted. I wrote, edited, and provided photos for the Travel section piece, my favorite byline ever.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-3-3-3">
          <h4>A Form Field Overhaul</h4>
          <p>One of my favorite byproducts of a project: a new form field strategy! Because form fields are part of the conversation too. <br> (Go on, ask me about my favorite.)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-3-3-3">
          <h4>An Ecommerce Homepage Redesign</h4>
          <p>We transformed it to give customers what they want, properly tell our brand story, and sell more phones. I made sure every space had a purpose and was relevant for our 32 international sites.</p>

      <section class="row">
        <div class="col-2-3">
          <h4>A Magazine Redesign</h4>
          <p>I played a key role in the redesign of a prominent publication that became a finalist in the best redesign category for the Jesse H. Neal Award, the B2B equivalent to a Pulitzer.</p>
